# Speedrun Web Randomizer

[Speedrun Web Randomizer](https://speedrunwr.com/) is a website to explore world record speedruns accessed through the [speedrun.com api](https://github.com/speedruncom/api) api.

Massive thanks to everyone involved with [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/) and to the the speedrun community for doing what they do and providing us with so much free entertainment.

Thank you to everyone who used (and especially those that stuck around) the old experimental website, you gave me the motivation (and suggestions) to re-engineer and add new features to the website.

Quick summary of the recent changes to the website:
- Filters - The crux of the update lies here, i've had a lot of fun finding interesting videos to watch with these.
- Users - If you create a user you can "like" runs so you can view them later.
- Autoplay
- Shareable links
- Lots of other little things

When creating a new project I like to experiment with technology that I'm interested in or want to learn more about. This project uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) as a back-end with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) on the front-end and a [Python](https://www.python.org/) script for some api data gathering. 

Learning new things takes time and experimentation and every time I'm nearly finished with something new I have to resist the urge to scrap it all and start again. If you take the time to look through the code you could probably notice some improvement, some regrets, some "getting things done" and probably some things you don't like. I'm always open to constructive criticism and suggestions so please feel free to reach out to me.

I don't plan on spending much more time on the project because it's time to move on to new ones!
